      <p>MakerSquare is a full-time, ten week program that turns you into a web developer. I am drinking the Kool-Aid and giving this whole internet thing a go.  Thanks to MakerSquare I was able to enter the cheat codes to level up much quicker and get all the swag.  I completed the course in January 2014.

      <p>&#x27;the SHED&#x27; is a web application used to support a community tool sharing program.  This project was motivated by us not wanting to buy expensive tools for one off projects. We thought it would be better if you could just borrow a tool from somebody who lives close to you. We reduce overall consumption, save money, and build a stronger community.</p>

<p>Users can create accounts and browse the tools their neighbors have listed for sharing. A user can then send a request to borrow a tool from a neighbor. If the neighbor approves their request, they can meet off line to hand off the desired tool.</p>

<p>This was a group project worked on by myself, Elaine Looney, and Jennifer Scales.  This was out final project as part of the MakerSquare, 10-week web development boot camp.  We used a combination of Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js to build the SHED.  We spent roughly 2.5 weeks working on the shed.  We spent the first day of the project making sure we had a firm grasp of the models we needed and their interconnectedness.  After that we spent time thinking about our user stories and what screens&#x2F;actions we wanted our user to be capable of.  After we had laid the groundwork to focus the project, we started with scaffolding a rails application.  This is a great jumping off point and one of the things that makes Rails easy to start with.   </p>

<p>Our instructors told us we were one of the few groups to use Backbone.js in our project.  I had wanted some practice working with a JavaScript Model View Controller (MVC) Framework.  Granted with Backbone the &#x27;C&#x27; is not for cookie or even controller.  Backbone falls into the MV* grouping of frameworks, giving you a Model, View, Collection, and Router.  In our project we used backbone as the main way to get visual representations of our models on a page, when we are working with more than one model at a time.  Combining the backbone collection view and the Masonry Javascript library made for nice looking index views.  In other views we took similar approaches to utilize the collections combined with an OWL-carousel JQuery plugin to get a slick horizontal view of our models.</p>

<p>We tried to keep ourselves amused as programmers along the way.  During the early phases of the project, the project had a very cat meme aspect to it where we were calling it &quot;You Can Haz?&quot;.  The cat theme crept into many places and there were even some cat themed seed data in the beginning.  As we cleaned up the code and removed all the Catz, it made me want to go back to an early templating idea for the project.  So, I went back and made all references to the application name and references to the type of resource that was being shared as templated variables.  The next day I was able to show the group, by just changing a few variables the Catz could easily sneak their way back into the project.  The templating idea lives on as a feature to support other coders re-using our project for their own customizable sharing projects.  Later in the project as we were locking down our routes, we decided to have a little fun with our 404 page.  Two of the group members were aware of the change and we were vastly amused when the third member stumbled across the new 404 page which has a cat telling them that someone haz borrowed the page they were looking for.  One of our other little code jokes, was passing around JSON in variables named @jason.  As a coder I like to imagine other coders coming across my little jokes in the future and being amused.</p>

<p>So, feel free to go check out the github read me for more project details about the SHED.

      <p>ActorShowtimes is a web app designed with a straight forward concept in mind, you tell it an Actor&#x27;s name and a zipcode, and it will respond with the current showtimes for any movie that Actor is in. The initial version was created as a weekend Hackathon project for the MakerSquare program.</p>

<p>There are two main use cases for this app.  The first use case assumes that a user has not set up an account.  In this case the user can enter in an actor&#x27;s name and zipcode, after which the app will report back the current movies and showtimes for that actor in the specified zipcode.  </p>

<p>The second use case, is only supported if a user has created an account.  This use case allows the user to use the same search feature from the first use case.  In addition, it allows a user to maintain a list of followed actors.  When a user signs in they can see the list of the actors they have followed and check each one for current showtimes.</p>

<p>We used Ruby on Rails for the front end site and Zurb Foundation for the styling.  For the user login process we used the Devise gem.   There are two main process involved with this app.  The first process utilize &#x27;themoviedb&#x27; gem.  This is a Ruby wrapper for the The Movie Database API.  The Movie Database, themoviedb.org, is a free and community maintained movie database.  We do an API call to search for the specified actor.  If we find a matching actor, we then do another call to get a list of their current movies.  The second process involves checking Google for showtimes for each movie based on the location provided by the user.  We use the Nokogiri gem to process these showtimes.  As a final step we show a google map with the locations of the theatres where the movies are playing.
